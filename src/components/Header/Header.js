              Food Tourism, or Culinary Tourism, is traveling to explore and enjoy a
              destination's unique food and drink. Itâ€™s about experiencing the culture
              through local dishes, street food, cooking classes, food festivals, and
              markets. From Italian pasta to Thai street food, food tourism connects
              travelers to the heart of a place through its flavors and traditions.
